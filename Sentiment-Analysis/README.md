# **Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews**

## **Overview**
The purpose of this project is to build a basic sentiment analysis system that classifies product reviews as either positive or negative. We utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and a machine learning model to classify the sentiment.

## **Objective**

The goal is to classify product reviews based on their text content, determining whether they express a positive or negative sentiment.

## **Tools and Libraries Used**

- **NLTK**: Used for natural language preprocessing tasks like tokenization, stop-word removal, and text normalization.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for machine learning model implementation, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Pandas**: For data handling and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
## **Dataset**

The dataset consists of a small collection of manually labeled product reviews. Each review is labeled as "positive" (1) or "negative" (0).


## **Project Workflow**

### **1. Text Preprocessing**

- **Tokenization**: Break down text into individual words.
- **Stop-word Removal**: Remove common words that don't contribute much meaning (e.g., "the", "and").
- **Vectorization**: Convert the cleaned text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization.


### **2. Model Training**

- A A Naive Bayes Classifier is used for the classification task. It's a fast and efficient algorithm for text classification, particularly for small datasets.
- The dataset is split into training and test sets (75%-25%).
- Hyperparameter tuning is conducted using GridSearchCV with stratified cross-validation to optimize model performance.


### 3. Model Evaluation
- Accuracy is measured by comparing the predicted sentiment labels to the true labels in the test set.
- Additional metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, are provided for comprehensive evaluation.
- The model achieved a commendable accuracy on the dataset, demonstrating an effective understanding of sentiment in product reviews.

### Challenges
- **Limited Dataset**: The small dataset may hinder the model's generalizability to unseen reviews.
- **Feature Selection**: A simple bag-of-words representation was used; more sophisticated techniques like advanced NLP methods could be explored for improved feature extraction.

## Conclusion
This sentiment analysis project provides a basic framework for classifying product reviews using machine learning. Future work could involve exploring larger datasets and implementing more complex models to improve accuracy and robustness.
